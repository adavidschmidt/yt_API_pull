# Use YouTube API to pull channel video data

## Goals of project
1. Create a Python project to access the YouTube API to pull data from any YouTube channel for analysis.
2. Create the project in both a Jupyter Notebook and a .py file to allow for multiple ways to handle the data
3. Show representation on creating functions to be used multiple times and allow for other individuals to use the functions


## Possible improvements
1. Remove shorts from the data
   - Presently working to understand a way to determine if a video is a short through the JSON to remove it from the data
2. Allow for larger pull requests as the present code uses only a small portion of allotted API calls through YouTube API
